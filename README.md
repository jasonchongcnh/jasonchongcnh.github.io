# CNH Blog & Holographic Map Experiment

Welcome to the personal website and experimental platform of **Jason Chong**. This project serves as both a personal blog for sharing insights on technology and a testbed for advanced mapping concepts.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This website integrates a standard personal blog with an experimental "Holographic Map" interface. The project explores web technologies, spatial computing concepts, and modern UI design.

### Key Features

#### 1. Personal Blog 📝
- **Location**: `index.html`
- A responsive blog layout sharing learning notes and projects.
- **Topics**: STEM, VR (Virtual Reality), Arduino, Web Development, and more.
- **Design**: Clean, readable typography using Inter and sans-serif fonts, powered by W3.CSS and custom styles.

#### 2. Holographic Map Interface 🗺️
- **Location**: `Map.html`
- A futuristic map interface built with the **AMap API**.
- **Concept**: Simulates a "Holographic Map" based on Gaussian Splatting and Beidou Satellite Navigation System integration.
- **Features**:
    - **Glassmorphism UI**: Floating panels with blur effects for a modern look.
    - **Geolocation**: High-accuracy positioning to locate the user.
    - **Custom Markers**: Interactive pins for schools and museums with custom SVG icons.
    - **Dark/Light Mode**: Optimized for visual clarity.

#### 3. Video Positioning & Upload 📹
- **Location**: `upload.html`
- A dedicated interface for uploading video content tagged with geolocation data.
- **Features**:
    - Drag-and-drop video upload.
    - Automatic and manual location picking.
    - Integration with the main map system.
